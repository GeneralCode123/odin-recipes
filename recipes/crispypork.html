    <h1>Crispy Pork</h1>
    <img src="../assets/img/crispy pork.jpg" width="250" height="250">
    <p>Crispy Pork features tender, flavorful pork belly with irresistibly crunchy skin. After boiling to achieve juicy meat, 
    the pork skin is dried and deep-fried until golden and crackly, creating a perfect balance of soft and crispy textures that pairs wonderfully with dipping sauces or as a main dish.
