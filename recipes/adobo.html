    <h1>Pork Adobo</h1>
    <img src="porkadobo.jpg" width="50" height="50">
    <p>Pork Adobo is a classic Filipino dish known for its rich, savory flavor and tender meat. 
    It is traditionally made by simmering chunks of pork—often a combination of fatty and lean cuts—in a marinade of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. 
    As it cooks, the meat absorbs the bold, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors of the sauce, resulting in a deeply flavorful dish with a glossy, caramelized finish.
